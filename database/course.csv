In other words, this course will study globalization from below.  We will address questions such as how do men and women around the world mediate the processes of globalization?  How do they understand them?  How is globalization implicated in their wellbeing, occupations, family lives, intimacies, futures?  In addition, students will be challenged to think about the interactions between the issues of social justice, human rights, and the anthropological dedication to cultural rights of the populations they study.","INTCL,PBK"94355,HIST-321-A,Top US Hist:US & Cold War,4,,E.Tebbenhoff,9/2/2015 0:00:00,12/17/2015 0:00:00,A,,"09/02/2015-12/17/2015 Lecture Monday, Wednesday, Friday 02:45PM - 03:45PM, Koren, Room 216","No other event of the twentieth century - not the Great Depression, the Second World War, the Civil Rights Movement -- shaped American history, politics and culture more than the Cold War.  The Cold War created a world divided and dominated by two ideologically opposed and antagonistic world powers, each possessing enough weaponry to destroy human civilization several times over.  The US and western European democracies exchanged economic, diplomatic, military and psychological threats with the Soviet Union and its satellites from 1945 to 1991 when the latter collapsed.  Periods of detente alternated with periods of high political drama.  Open war between the US and the Soviets nearly broke out on several occasions, including the Berlin Blockade of 1948-49, the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.  In addition, wars in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan, plus a variety of smaller conflicts, saw the two superpowers resorting to indirect war by proxy states to achieve their desired ends.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) grew exponentially, fighting important legal battles and lobbying the federal government to pass anti-lynching legislation. Harlem, Chicago, Washington DC, and Paris became sites of active black arts communities, filled with jazz and blues musicians, novelists and poets, painters and dancers, and entrepreneur owners of the spaces in which they drank. In the world of athletics, the Negro Leagues developed into important sites for community gathering. Despite such dynamismm, or perhaps because of it, cities across the nation erupted in racial conflict, often over the presence of black veterans returning home from WWI in their uniforms.

Some Kabuki and No plays function as religious ritual, while some Manga and Anime consciously reflect on moral attitudes and religious beliefs. These forms are also the product of various interactions among Japanese, Chinese, and American cultures.
