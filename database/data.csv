The course is intended to help students develop strategies for the production of effective written French. More complex grammatical, syntactic and stylistic structures, as well as more sophisticated vocabulary and expressions are introduced and practiced through a variety of activities: syntactic, structural and grammatical analysis of contemporary texts, study of common problem words for non-native French speakers, short translation and stylistic exercises, and guided writing projects in different genres.

This enigmatic phrase --initially attributed to Frederic Spiegelberg (1897-1994), popularized by Alan Watts (1915-1973), and advanced by Michael Murphy (1930-) and Richard Price (1930-1985)-- was used to describe what some experienced as mystical insight into the unity and interconnectedness of all things.  While looking at this phenomenon, students will examine the ways that Buddhist Tantra and meditation, Daoist practice, Indian Yoga, psychedelic drug use, and Western scientific studies of the paranormal were fused together to create a way of knowing and practicing that could engender liberation, forming what can be called an American mysticism.  Students will also assess the critique levied at intellectuals of this period for merely appropriating Buddhist, Daoist, and Hindu religious and philosophical ideas, texts, and practices for their own personal and political agendas and, as such, engaging in a kind of Orientalist discourse akin to nineteenth and early twentieth century scholarship on East and South Asian traditions.",Ockham House,S,Hurley,Humanities,REL,Religion,485,0,Fall 2015,9/2/2015,12/17/2015,18:00,21:00,,,,0.0,,,,,

This course explores a range of fictional and non-fictional imagined futures from various places and times with a particular focus on three main areas: Social Structures, Technology, and Environment. We will excavate past and contemporary visions of the future in order to learn how predictions, and the ethical positions from which they are built, are subject to the ideas of their times and places and to examine which factors influence the success or failure of these visions.

Has religion lost much of the influence it once had prior to modernity, or does modernity lead less to religious decline and more to changes in how people understand and practice religion? Why do these questions matter in the modern world, or do they? This Intersections seminar examines the interdisciplinary debate and the various theories concerning the causes of religious decline and change in the modern West. We will discuss those elements of modernity and modernization that are often viewed as culprits in secularization, including industrialization, urbanization, science, technology, economic prosperity, and religious pluralism. And we will grapple with the larger questions of what kind of distinction can be made within the West between a ""secular Europe"" and a ""religious America,"" and how the West differs from the Global South in terms of the influence of religion.

While relativism can be a symptom of intellectual laziness, there is also a long history of thinkers who take relativism seriously, arguing that theorizing the differences in human experience is the only way to truly understand our world. In this course we'll trace the intellectual history of relativism as a serious response to fundamental questions about the limits of human knowledge in the areas of natural science, morality, language, and politics. From the master rhetoricians and sophists of ancient Greece to contemporary post-modernists, this course invites students to critically assess the consequences, both ethical and philosophical, of a relativistic worldview.

The Cold War created a world divided and dominated by two ideologically opposed and antagonistic world powers, each possessing enough weaponry to destroy human civilization several times over.  The US and western European democracies exchanged economic, diplomatic, military and psychological threats with the Soviet Union and its satellites from 1945 to 1991 when the latter collapsed.  Periods of detente alternated with periods of high political drama.  Open war between the US and the Soviets nearly broke out on several occasions, including the Berlin Blockade of 1948-49, the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.  In addition, wars in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan, plus a variety of smaller conflicts, saw the two superpowers resorting to indirect war by proxy states to achieve their desired ends.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) grew exponentially, fighting important legal battles and lobbying the federal government to pass anti-lynching legislation.

In the world of athletics, the Negro Leagues developed into important sites for community gathering.
