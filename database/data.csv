Although these experiences arise out of a particular cultural context and are bound by time and space, they can inform and enrich our own faith experience and remain relevant.

According to theologian Paul Tillich, symbols are representations of the infinite in a finite form, pointing beyond themselves and opening up levels of reality otherwise veiled. The course will interpret symbolic religious language through religious images (icons), novels, music, and films. It will enable students to reflect on their own moral decision-making by studying how human beings interact, the meaning of humanity in its relation to the divine, the human condition and its representation(s), and how courage, acceptance, and forgiveness are manifested in the midst of ignorance and oppression.

Has religion lost much of the influence it once had prior to modernity, or does modernity lead less to religious decline and more to changes in how people understand and practice religion? Why do these questions matter in the modern world, or do they? This Intersections seminar examines the interdisciplinary debate and the various theories concerning the causes of religious decline and change in the modern West. We will discuss those elements of modernity and modernization that are often viewed as culprits in secularization, including industrialization, urbanization, science, technology, economic prosperity, and religious pluralism. And we will grapple with the larger questions of what kind of distinction can be made within the West between a ""secular Europe"" and a ""religious America,"" and how the West differs from the Global South in terms of the influence of religion.

While relativism can be a symptom of intellectual laziness, there is also a long history of thinkers who take relativism seriously, arguing that theorizing the differences in human experience is the only way to truly understand our world. In this course we'll trace the intellectual history of relativism as a serious response to fundamental questions about the limits of human knowledge in the areas of natural science, morality, language, and politics. From the master rhetoricians and sophists of ancient Greece to contemporary post-modernists, this course invites students to critically assess the consequences, both ethical and philosophical, of a relativistic worldview.

The Cold War created a world divided and dominated by two ideologically opposed and antagonistic world powers, each possessing enough weaponry to destroy human civilization several times over.  The US and western European democracies exchanged economic, diplomatic, military and psychological threats with the Soviet Union and its satellites from 1945 to 1991 when the latter collapsed.  Periods of detente alternated with periods of high political drama.  Open war between the US and the Soviets nearly broke out on several occasions, including the Berlin Blockade of 1948-49, the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.  In addition, wars in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan, plus a variety of smaller conflicts, saw the two superpowers resorting to indirect war by proxy states to achieve their desired ends.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) grew exponentially, fighting important legal battles and lobbying the federal government to pass anti-lynching legislation.

In the world of athletics, the Negro Leagues developed into important sites for community gathering. Despite such dynamismm, or perhaps because of it, cities across the nation erupted in racial conflict, often over the presence of black veterans returning home from WWI in their uniforms.
