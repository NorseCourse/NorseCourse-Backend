Topics include matrix algebra, vector spaces and subspaces, linear independence, determinants, bases, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, orthognality, and inner product spaces.",,,Olin,K,Fey,Sciences,MATH,Mathematics,240,0,Fall 2016,8/31/16,12/15/16,11:00,12:00,QUANT,Quantitative,,0.0,,,,896

The other was his own radical imaginative universe, including God, Milton, Satan, sex, and mythic figures with names like Oothoon, Los, and Golgonooza.  In the process of art-making -- relief-etching his drawings and painting on copper plates, then printing and coloring his designs by hand -- he strove to unite the visible and invisible worlds, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.

By becoming more interdisciplinary and intersectional, theological discourses and practices have been able to present an array of constructive theologies. Pulling from fields such as literary criticism, continental philosophy, political science, or ecological thought (to mention a few) has afforded new intellectual engagement to theological questions, particularly those related to the orthopraxy of contextual theological movements. These constructive theologies identify overlapping social identities and related systems of oppression, while also pointing out modes of liberation drawn from the strategies presented by these contextual movements. Among the authors to be studied are Catherine Keller (Cloud of the Impossible: Negative Theology and Planetary Entanglement ), Kelly Brown Douglas (Stand Your Ground: Black Bodies and the Justice of God), J_rgen Moltmann (The Living God and the Fullness of Life), Kristin Johnston Largen (Baby Krishna, Infant Christ: A Comparative Theology of Salvation) and Robert C.

We will trace the development of major genres, including the symphony, string quartet, concerto, aria, and oratorio. Students will consider how Classical composers contributed to Western Art Music by inventing or codifying some of the most enduring genres and forms and by creating the Galant style. We will then explore how Romantic composers transformed the genres, forms, and harmonic language inherited from Classical composers. Many of these changes resulted from a desire to express emotions and ideas through music, as we will see. Historical, social, and political factors that affected music and musical life will also be investigated.
