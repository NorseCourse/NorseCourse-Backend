By becoming more interdisciplinary and intersectional, theological discourses and practices have been able to present an array of constructive theologies. Pulling from fields such as literary criticism, continental philosophy, political science, or ecological thought (to mention a few) has afforded new intellectual engagement to theological questions, particularly those related to the orthopraxy of contextual theological movements. These constructive theologies identify overlapping social identities and related systems of oppression, while also pointing out modes of liberation drawn from the strategies presented by these contextual movements. Among the authors to be studied are Catherine Keller (Cloud of the Impossible: Negative Theology and Planetary Entanglement ), Kelly Brown Douglas (Stand Your Ground: Black Bodies and the Justice of God), Jrgen Moltmann (The Living God and the Fullness of Life), Kristin Johnston Largen (Baby Krishna, Infant Christ: A Comparative Theology of Salvation) and Robert C.

This course aims to connect the concepts and approaches of genetics to societal issues relating to health, diversity, forensics, and evolution. The course will provide basic coverage of the science of genetics, including the structure, expression, and transmission of heritable information and the evolution of populations. Methods and techniques, such as gene cloning and DNA fingerprinting, will be covered to provide information on how scientists use genetic technology to answer questions. Also included will be discussion of some of the ethical and social questions surrounding issues as diverse as screening human embryos for genetic traits, evaluating the genetic basis of aggressive behavior, and creating genetically modified organisms.
