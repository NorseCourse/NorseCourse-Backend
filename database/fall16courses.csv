The narratives studied in this course assume a spiritual topography that includes demons, ghosts, and gods, probe the gender and sexual identities of their characters, and introduce self-cultivation techniques such as martial arts. In particular, this course will focus on two traditional, narrative forms, Kabuki and No, and two contemporary ones, Manga and Anime. Some Kabuki and No plays function as religious ritual, while some Manga and Anime consciously reflect on moral attitudes and religious beliefs. These forms are also the product of various interactions among Japanese, Chinese, and American cultures. Analyzing these four kinds of cultural and religious expressions, the course examines the role of religious ritual and sacred texts in premodern as well as contemporary Japan. The course introduces students to religious studies methodology, critical theory (including gender and queer studies), and intercultural analysis. It will also deepen the skills in textual and literary criticism introduced in the courses fulfilling the Bible requirement.

Students in this seminar will explore the legacy of Muslim culture in Spain with a special focus on the period 1492-1650 and later on the impact of contemporary African immigration to Spain.  We will look at several kinds of cultural texts:  frontier ballads of the Reconquista, a Morisco novel, an Inquisition trial, a documentary film, and the Mosque/Cathedral of Cordoba.  Our aim will be to use these and other texts to respond to key questions about Islamic culture in Spain:  What are the principal narratives told about Spain's Islamic heritage""  What exactly was ""reconquered"" by the end of the 15th century?  What were the consequences of expelling Moors and Moriscos from Spain?  How did Spanish Muslims respond to forced conversion and hostility toward their religion and cultural practices?  How does the country's Muslim past shape responses to contemporary immigration to Spain?  Students will formulate answers to these questions in informal writing as well as in a formal research project.","08/31/2016-12/15/2016 Seminar Tuesday, Thursday 12:45PM - 02:15PM, Main, Room 212","A seminar with rotating topics on Spanish peninsular literature and culture.

This course takes the medium of film, and examines the various ways in which the medieval and early modern world has been represented in it.  The course is divided into a series of units, each concerned with a different aspect of medieval and early modern life (e.g. warfare, religiosity, philosophy and learning, romance, etc.)  For each unit, students analyze a selection of scholarly background material, as well as a number of primary sources, written and visual.  Students will use the knowledge amassed through these sources to assess the choices made by screenwriters and directors as they portray scences from the past.  Our task is therefore two-fold:  to better understand the historical reality of the Middle Ages, and to assess the choices made by modern screenwriters as they construct their own portrayals of that historical reality for modern audiences.","HB,HIST,PBK",,Take Paideia 112D or the equivalent.

In the world of athletics, the Negro Leagues developed into important sites for community gathering. Despite such dynamismm, or perhaps because of it, cities across the nation erupted in racial conflict, often over the presence of black veterans returning home from WWI in their uniforms.

According to theologian Paul Tillich, symbols are representations of the infinite in a finite form, pointing beyond themselves and opening up levels of reality otherwise veiled. The course will interpret symbolic religious language through religious images (icons), novels, music, and films. It will enable students to reflect on their own moral decision-making by studying how human beings interact, the meaning of humanity in its relation to the divine, the human condition and its representation(s), and how courage, acceptance, and forgiveness are manifested in the midst of ignorance and oppression.

The influence of non-Western music, pre-nineteenth-century music, and popular music on Western Art Music will also be explored, as will the ways that nationalism, censorship, politics, and advances in technology shape music from this period. The second half of the course introduces students to the music of some non-Western cultures. Taking a case study approach, we will investigate the music of select cultures from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, focusing on the instruments, methods of organizing music, performance contexts, and the significance and meaning of music-making in each culture. We will examine how music helps to express identity and how transmission and globalization affect music. We will conclude by studying a North American musical tradition outside of the Western Art Music sphere, from an ethnomusicological perspective, exposing students to some of the methodologies and key questions of the field.

The course then explores how these various regions successfully cooperated with one another long enough to engage in an independence movement that separated them from Great Britain and created the United States. These regional differences lived on into the nineteenth century, however, and became the basis for the sectional conflict which erupted into Civil War in 1861.

One was Romantic-era London, where politics, perception, and poetry were in constant flux.  The other was his own radical imaginative universe, including God, Milton, Satan, sex, and mythic figures with names like Oothoon, Los, and Golgonooza.  In the process of art-making -- relief-etching his drawings and painting on copper plates, then printing and coloring his designs by hand -- he strove to unite the visible and invisible worlds, ""melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.""  Together, we'll read a wide selection of work by Blake and his contemporaries, write about them, and even [I hope] try our own hands at printmaking to understand Blake's deep belief that the artist's imagination can remake the physical world and to ponder what he means for us now.",,,"Take 2 courses from Eng 251, 352-354, 361-368"

Literally and figuratively, dreams and fears are at the core of our humanness. They shape our actions and define our vision for the future. They can push us forward or hold us back. We can pursue them or run away from them. Dreams can turn into hopes, desires, and obsessions; fears intro aversions, hatred, and determination. The guiding question for this course will be: How do dreams and fears influence and shape human actions towards the common good? To find answers, we will look at dreams and fears from various angles, such as history, philosophy, psychology, sociology, political science, and art, with a focus on examples in modern Western society such as utopian/dystopian fiction, presidential election campaigns, and the notion of ""the American Dream.""

If so, you might find yourself busted by a ""grammar cop"" (or ""language cop"" or ""style cop""). Sometimes, these protectors of the English language get angry when new words are added to the dictionary, or they consider a person unintelligent for speaking with an accent. Sometimes they use language to include, exclude, rank and sort others into groups. Why is this? Why do some people find it important to protect standard English, and why do others choose to rebel against it? In this course, we'll examine these questions while experimenting with standard and non-standard types of written and spoken English.
