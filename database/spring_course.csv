These examples are hugely important but they are exceptional. More normally, slave rebellions were brief spasms of intense drama, often filled with bloodshed and incredible violence -- and a notable lack of success for the slaves. But in every case, they inspired intense fear and wild rumors throughout the white community. The course examines why such rebellions only periodically erupted, why they broke out where and when they did, and the reasons for their failure. The course focuses on three well-documented examples -- the New York Slave Conspiracy of 1741, Gabriel Prosser's Rebellion in Richmond (Virginia), South Carolina in 1800, and Nat Turner's Rebellion in Southampton County (Virginia) in 1831.

The course will focus on ways in which Chinese artists of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have defined modernity and their tradition against the complex background of China's history. The course will also examine how Chinese artists have chosen to adopt Western conventions and the extent to which they have rejected them. Through examining art works in different media, including oil painting, graphic design, woodblock prints, traditional ink-and-color painting, and recent performance, installation and video art, along with theoretical writing, bibliographical and institutional data, and other documentary materials, the course will investigate the most compelling of the multiple realities that Chinese artists have constructed for themselves. By learning about the complexity of modern and contemporary Chinese art, and the historical forces behind them, students will gain fuller understanding of twentieth-century modernism. ","HIST,HEPT"

This course will briefly examine historical conditions that laid the foundation for what is recognized today as an international field of contemporary art and explore in depth some of the most critical issues in the field. Even as art-exhibiting practices continue to associate artists with their nationalities, much of contemporary art in the 21st century challenge the dominancy of racial, cultural and national identities as the most salient factors for their understanding. The course will explore how forces of globalization have shaped artistic practice and critical interpretation. More than ever before, artists today are multi-national or multi-cultural, explore global or transnational issues in their art, and exhibit internationally. At the same time that ""peripheral"" cities (Dubai, Budapest, Johannesburg, Beijing, Havana, etc.) and regions (Asia, Middle East, Latin America, etc.) across the world participate in the production of ""contemporary art,"" certain artists and curators have promoted the development of localized practices and site-specificity as corrective forces for maintaining diversity and growth. This course will focus on a select body of artworks and texts produced by figures within the wide world of contemporary art in order to understand the positions they represent. Embedded within three thematic units will be examinations of specific geographical regions, artists, aesthetic and conceptual currents, as well as larger theoretical frameworks such as post-colonial, postmodern, gender, and diaspora studies.

But this creation raises complex moral and ethical issues that call into question the very nature of the creator and the created. For example, in Genesis 1-3, God creates Adam and Eve and places them in the Garden of Eden. But then he alerts them to a tree called ""the tree of the knowledge of good and evil"" and warns them not to eat of its fruits least they die. Regardless of the warning, Adam and Eve eat of the fruit, leading to the Adam/Eve ""blame game"" and God's punishments of the duo that rupture the relationship between Adam and Eve. It transforms the relationship from ""bone of my ""bones"" to ""thorn in my flesh."" This necessitates a reflection on a number of questions: Did God set Adam/Eve up for failure? Why did God give different punishments? In Genesis 4 God accepts Abel's offering while rejecting that of Cain leading to the first human hatred and murder in the Bible. Why does God favor one offering over and against another (in the process creating good/bad attributes for Cain/Abel)? This course is an exegetical study that seeks to address the politics of creation inherent in Genesis (who is God? Why does he create through differentiation?
